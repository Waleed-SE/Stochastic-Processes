# Stochastic Processes & Statistical Modeling: Simplified Guide

This repository contains practical implementations of statistical models and random processes in R. The code uses only built-in R functions to demonstrate key concepts in probability, prediction, and data analysis.

## What's Inside This Repository

- **Probability Basics**: Understanding chance and uncertainty
- **Random Processes**: How random events evolve over time
- **Prediction Models**: Making forecasts using past observations
- **Waiting Line Analysis**: How to model queues and service systems
- **Spatial Pattern Analysis**: Modeling patterns across space and time

## Key Concepts Explained

### What is Probability?

Probability gives us ways to measure and talk about uncertainty. In this repository, we cover:

- **Combining Events**: How to calculate chances of multiple events happening
- **Conditional Probability**: How new information changes our predictions
- **Bayes' Rule**: Updating beliefs based on new evidence

### What are Stochastic Processes?

A stochastic process is just a fancy name for a sequence of random events that evolve over time. Think of:

- The ups and downs of a stock price
- The number of customers arriving at a store
- The spread of information through a social network

We classify these processes based on whether:

- They have discrete or continuous values
- Time moves in steps or flows continuously
- Future states depend only on the present state or on past history too

### What is a Markov Chain?

A Markov chain is a special type of random process where the future depends only on the present state, not on the past history.

**Example**: Weather patterns can often be modeled as a Markov chain. The chance of rain tomorrow might depend on whether it's raining today, but not on whether it rained last week.

Key concepts include:

- **State Transitions**: The probabilities of moving between different states
- **Long-term Behavior**: Where the system tends to settle after a long time
- **Expected Return Times**: How long it takes to return to a particular state

### What is a Hidden Markov Model?

Sometimes we can't directly observe the process we're interested in. A Hidden Markov Model helps us make inferences about a hidden process based on related observations we can see.

**Example**: When analyzing speech, we don't directly observe the words someone intended to say, only the sound waves they produced.

### What is a Poisson Process?

A Poisson process models random events that happen independently at a constant average rate.

**Examples**:

- Customer arrivals at a store
- Calls to a help center
- Accidents on a stretch of highway

Key properties include knowing the probability of exactly N events occurring in a fixed time period.

### What is Queueing Theory?

Queueing theory helps us analyze waiting lines. It combines arrival patterns and service times to predict:

- Average waiting times
- Queue lengths
- Resource utilization

This is essential for designing efficient service systems like call centers, hospitals, or checkout counters.

### What are Gaussian Processes?

Gaussian processes are flexible tools for making predictions about unknown values based on observed data points. Unlike simpler methods, they capture uncertainty about their predictions.

**Examples**:

- Temperature prediction across geographical locations
- Forecasting time series data with uncertainty bands
- Finding patterns in noisy measurements

## Implementation Files

This repository includes several R scripts:

- `matrix_operations.R`: Basic matrix math operations
- `markov_chains.R`: Models where future only depends on present state
- `markov_chains.py`: Python version of the Markov chain implementation
- `hmm_and_poisson.R`: Models for hidden states and random event arrivals
- `queueing_theory.R`: Tools for analyzing waiting lines and service systems
- `gaussian_processes.R`: Flexible prediction models with uncertainty estimates
- `poisson_process_calculator.R`: Calculator for random arrival processes

Each file contains detailed implementations with extensive comments and practical examples.

## Getting Started

To use these implementations:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the R scripts in RStudio or your preferred R environment
3. Run the examples to see the models in action
4. Modify the parameters to fit your specific use case

The code is well-documented to help you understand both the mathematics and the implementation details.
